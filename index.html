                            from Flexport and a recent Computer Science
                            graduate from Louisiana State University
                            looking for employment. My goal has always been
                            to broaden my knowledge as much as possible in
                            various subdisciplines while still focusing and diving deep on
                            my core career areas.

                            Some of the most significant ways I have broadened my horizons are by pursuing a mathematics

                            of these goals have their own set of challenges and have contributed towards each other as I
                            have been able to apply skills I learn in one area to others.

                        <p>
                            Through both my projects and professional experience, I have developed many full stack
                            skills. I enjoy the wide range of challenges it brings, and the chances to learn many new
                            technologies, from databases, to APIs, to UI design and implementation.

                        <p>
                            Although sometimes different than what initially drew me to programming, I greatly enjoy
                            user interface programming and user experience design. The unique set of challenges it
                            brings and the instant results brings me great satisfaction.

                            balance scalability, security, and performance is a great challenge. Just as well, making an
                            API that both properly abstracts the data, is easy to use, and has a robust contract is a
                            problem I find fascinating.

                                In my brief time at Flexport I was able to contribute towards the reduction of trucking
                                overcharge by over 50%. I first improved back-end integrations our procurement
                                database. This allowed for better and stricter invoice validations on the frontend and
                                backend, resulting in the number of charges with bad rates to be reduced from over 60%
                                of all charge to under 15%.

                                Aside from general frontend and backend tasks, I was able to contribute in designing
                                systems and analyzing data as well. I designed and implemented an end-to-end document
                                upload system which would allow for proof of charge document requirements. Just as well,
                                I developed queries for an analytics dashboard to assess invoicing accuracy and leakage
                                using Snowflake. I also participated in the data analysis from the dashboard to identify
                                critical areas of overcharge.

                                My experience as a software engineer at Flexport, however short, was valuable in
                                allowing me to experience the fast-paced environment of a software engineer and the
                                expectations that come with that. I was able to learn a lot about the software and
                                freight forwarding industries, as well as have a more impactful role than I could have
                                had in my internship. As a full time software engineer, I had to not just learn and
                                implement things with minimal guidance, but make impactful design decisions and
                                communicate with stakeholders to ensure the best possible outcomes.

                                SCRUM meetings, organized communications between stakeholders of the support feature,
                                and efficiently gather requirements and recommendations for the feature.

                                Simultaneously, I was able to learn and operate mostly autonomously on a day-to-day
                                basis, learning new technologies and developing the support feature, with my teammates
                                and manager answering any questions if I became stuck.

                                the stakeholder from which I got feedback about the performance and ease of use of the
                                tools.

                                significantly helped me develop my software development skills precisely because of

                                from previous Communication Intensive courses at LSU such as my introductory Honors
                                course or my Object-Oriented Programming course. These, combined with the feedback I got

                            This project was developed in a 5 person group as part of CSC 4243 Interface Design.
                            The purpose of this project was to develop a good user interface for some software of our
                            choosing by going through various rounds of user testing and using that feedback to iterate
                            on the design. My role in this project was leading development of the front-end code for the
                            home page and browsing, as well as managing the continous integration pipeline with
                            GitHub flow version control strategy.
                        <p class="project-desc">
                            Through the development process, users tested the software through series of
                            interviews, surveys, and observations. This allowed us to witness users using the design and
                            get their direct feedback to apply to the design iterations. For this project we chose to
                            use NASA image APIs as a data source as that allowed us to not have to worry about
                            developing a backend and focus more on the GUI itself.

                            The motivation behind this project was to help the high school robotics team I was
                            mentoring plan their autonomous paths for thei competition robot. I also wanted to
                            try my hand at making a desktop application not using Electron. In addition, I wanted
                            to try out Rust and gain a deeper understanding of the path-planning algorithm used
                            in WPILib, which all coincided into me making the app in Tauri.

                            The challenge of creating an extremely functional but visually appealing UI is
                            always a fun one to me, as it offers one of the best stages to test one's UX chops.
                            Although the project is fairly simple now, I plan to continue to develop it, as it
                            allows me to explore a lot of different technologies and concepts I am interested in.

                            projects, so I wanted to try to develop a better interface to try them out than the one
                            provided by Google.
                        <p class="project-desc">
                            I decided an up-and-coming technology like Svelte would be a good choice due to its rapidly
                            rising popularity and continued praise from its community. So, from there, I worked to
                            create a simple web-based tool to help developers like me pick fonts and color schemes.

                            The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of common computer science
                            algorithms and of Javascript as a language. I wanted to develop a more intuitive
                            understanding of these algorithms so that I could better apply them when needed, so I
                            decided the best way would be to implement them for myself and develop a visualization
                            scheme in the process.
                        <p class="project-desc">
                            I was also worried that in my studies I was focusing too much on Javascript in the context
                            of frameworks and libraries, and so had a goal to develop this with entirely vanilla
                            Javascript. This was so I could better understand the language and event-driven programming
                            in general.
                        <p class="project-desc">
                            The result was a painful but crucial leap in understanding of both computer
                            science algorithms and Javascript, as well as a lightweight application to visualize sorting
                            and pathfinding algorithms.

                                The most important aspect of this project from a project management perspective is
                                communication between the team members. Due to the fast paced nature of game
                                development, without good communication, heavy refactoring and bug-fixing could be
                                needed for what should be simple feature merges.
                            <p class="project-desc">
                                For this, we decided to use Trello as our project management software which allowed us
                                to easily visualize everyone's progress in a glance. Also, biweekly progress meetings
                                were set up to coordinate development of assets, the game world, and scripts. Finally a
                                version control strategy known as GitHub flow was implemented which allows each person
                                to work independently and any changes to be rectified by both parties whose code
                                conflicts.
